              <p>Christopher Zavala, here. Please take a look around.</p>

              <p>I am passionate about building excellent software full stack applications that improve
              the lives of those around me. I am thoughtful and extremely diligent about the projects that I create.
              I also have an electrical engineering degree, so I have a vastly diverse technical background. I will be graduating from my coding 
              bootcamp from The University of Texas at Austin, by mid March 2023.
              </p><br></br> 
              
              <p>My goal from this journey is to refine my craft and skill in this coding bootcamp to become a MERN full-stack web developer with the skills 
              necessary to enjoy my new career but also bring the skills that I have learned through all my life experiences.  
              I have a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Electrical Engineering and I also have a love for the engineering process and solving problems.
              </p><br></br>
              
             <p>With this brief introduction that I have told you, I hope to have given you a little understanding about what I like to do and love to create. 
              I hope you enjoy this site as much as I have enjoyed the process of bringing this site to life! Thank you.
